# GEDI Data in Python

GEDI is an exciting new sensor that has a revolutionary new way of monitoring and analyzing our earth. Launched in 2018, the [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/gedi-l4-data) takes precise measurements of forest canopy, structure, and surface elevation using an array of LIDAR instruments. These data can be used to estimate the above ground biomass over large regions, alongside many other uses! For this notebook, we will be focusing on the GEDI 4A product, which is a derived dataset that estimates the aboveground biomass density.

For this lesson, we will open up 2 GEDI data files and clip them to the boundary of the [Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed Data](https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/boise-id/northwest-watershed-research-center/docs/reynolds-creek-experimental-watershed-data/).

The code for this lesson is from the [ORNL DAAC GEDI tutorials GitHub page](https://github.com/ornldaac/gedi_tutorials/blob/main/2_gedi_l4a_subsets.ipynb).

##Functions to assist

GEDI data is stored in an .h5 file format, which is a hierarchical data structure. Part of the reason the data is stored in a hierarchical data structure is the amount of data that GEDI collects. According to NASA's page on GEDI, "The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track." These 8 beams all need to be handled in our code in order to get all the information from the source data!

We can use the package `h5py` to open up these dataset. Written below are two helper functions that assist with the workflow. The first helper function clips GEDI data beams to only be in our study area, the second function copies the information from each of the GEDI beams to an file so we can access it more easily. These functions will be used in workflows further on in the lesson. 

def clip_gedi_beam(beam, gdf):
  """

## Opening data to clip to

Here we open the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed boundary data. This is a watershed that is highly monitored and studied Idaho. This is the area that we'll be clipping our GEDI data to. 

# Import geojson as GeoDataFrame
rcew_boundary = gpd.read_file(path.join(data_path, 'Hay_sch_polys.geojson')) 

# Plot GedDataFrame to check the data
rcew_boundary.plot(figsize=(10, 5), edgecolor='red')

#GEDI metadata

In order to effectively use GEDI data, it's important to know the file structure and how the data is organized within the .h5 files. There are a few ways to do this. 

One way would be to find the metadata, either from the downloaded data or online. GEDI L4A data has [documentation online](https://daac.ornl.gov/GEDI/guides/GEDI_L4A_AGB_Density_V2.html) explaining all the variables stored within the files and what they represent. 

Even with this information, it can still be helpful to open your file in python and check the key names stored within the files. To do this, we can open up just one of the files we'll be using and look at the keys with `.keys()`.

# Creating a list of all GEDI files we're going to open
indir = path.join(data_path, 'GEDI_4A')
gedi_files_list = glob(path.join(indir, 'GEDI04_A*.h5'))
gedi_files_list


# Opening up the first GEDI file to check the metadata
hf = h5py.File(gedi_files_list[0], 'r')
# Getting a list of the BEAM names as well as other data in the file
hf.keys()

You'll notice that these are the name of each of the 8 beams that GEDI uses to collect data, in addition to ancillary data and metadata. As this data is hierarchical, each of these beams also has keys for the data stored in it. We can repeat the same process of grabbing one of the beams and checking it's keys to see a list of the data available to us. In the output below you should see a key called `agbd`, which stands for aboveground biomass density. It's measured in megagrams per hectare(Mg/ha). It's not a direct measurement but the predicted amount of AGBD based on the GEDI readings. We will want this data from the GEDI beam, alongside the `lat_lowestmode` and `lon_lowestmode` in order to get the spatial coordinates of the readings. 

# Checking all of the variables that are stored within each BEAM 
beam0110 = hf.get('BEAM0110')
beam0110.keys()

# Closing the file connection
hf.close()

#Clipping the GEDI beams

To clip the GEDI beams, what we're actually doing is getting the indices of the readings in the dataset that are within our study area, and then subsetting the dataset to only include those readings. We then create a new `.h5` file, copy all the metadata and ancillary data from the original data we're clipping from, then write out the subsetted dataset to our new output file.  

# Creating a directory to write our modified data to
outdir = path.join(data_path, 'output_dir')

if not path.isdir(outdir):
  os.mkdir(outdir)

# Loop through all GEDI files and clip to study area
for infile in gedi_files_list:
    # Getting name of the original file and using it to create the output file name
    name, ext = path.splitext(path.basename(infile))
    subfilename = "{name}_sub{ext}".format(name=name, ext=ext)
    outfile = path.join(outdir, path.basename(subfilename))
    hf_in = h5py.File(infile, 'r')
    hf_out = h5py.File(outfile, 'w')
        
    # Copy ANCILLARY and METADATA groups to output file
    var1 = ["/ANCILLARY", "/METADATA"]
    for v in var1:
        hf_in.copy(hf_in[v],hf_out)
    
    # Loop through BEAMXXXX groups
    for hf_key in list(hf_in.keys()):
        if hf_key.startswith('BEAM'):
            beam = hf_in[hf_key]
            # Find the shots that overlays the area of interest (RCEW)
            indices = clip_gedi_beam(beam=beam, gdf=rcew_boundary)
            # Copy BEAMS to the output file
            for key, value in beam.items():
                if isinstance(value, h5py.Group):
                    for key2, value2 in value.items():
                        copy_beam_to_outfile(key=key2, value=value2, out_file=hf_out, indices=indices)
                else:
                    copy_beam_to_outfile(key=key, value=value, out_file=hf_out, indices=indices)
    # Close both files 
    hf_in.close()
    hf_out.close()

# Opening clipped data

Now that we have clipped our data, we can open the output files we've created and only read in the variables we need for our analysis, those being `lat_lowestmode`, `lon_lowestmode`, and `agbd`. We can read the data from those variable into lists and load those lists into a `GeoDataFrame`. This is what we can then use to analyze and plot our data.  

# Creating lists to read the desired variables into
lat_lowestmode,lon_lowestmode, agbd = ([] for i in range(3))

# Looping through all files created in the cell above
for subfile in glob(path.join(outdir, 'GEDI04_A*.h5')):
    hf_in = h5py.File(subfile, 'r')
    for hf_key in list(hf_in.keys()):
        # Reading all beams that are in our files
        if hf_key.startswith('BEAM'):
            # Adding the latitude, longitude, and AGBD measurements to the lists we created
            beam = hf_in[hf_key]
            lat_lowestmode.extend(beam['lat_lowestmode'][:].tolist()) 
            lon_lowestmode.extend(beam['lon_lowestmode'][:].tolist()) 
            agbd.extend(beam['agbd'][:].tolist())
    hf_in.close()

# Zipping the lists together to associate the correct data with the correct latitude/longitude
geo_arr = list(zip(lat_lowestmode,lon_lowestmode, agbd))
# Reading the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(geo_arr, columns=["lat_lowestmode","lon_lowestmode","agbd"])
# Turning the pandas DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame by extracting the geometry information from the latitude and longitude columns 
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(df.lon_lowestmode, df.lat_lowestmode))
# Removing agbd measurements that have a no data value
gdf = gdf[gdf.agbd != -9999]
gdf

#Plot the data!

We've now completed all the steps we need to plot GEDI 4A data! Here we'll plot it with the boundary to show how it was clipped. 

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(22, 7))
rcew_boundary.geometry.boundary.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='red', linewidth=5)
gdf.plot(ax=ax, column='agbd', linewidth=0, legend=True, alpha = 0.8)
ctx.add_basemap(ax, crs=rcew_boundary.crs.to_string(), source=ctx.providers.Esri.WorldImagery)
