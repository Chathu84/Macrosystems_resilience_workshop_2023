Before performing any operations on our data, we need to load a package for working with geospatial raster data. 'terra' is a newer package that is becoming more dominant, while 'raster' is its predecessor.

```{r}
#Load necessary libraries
library(terra) #New raster data package, documentation pdf here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf
```

Now we want to load in some of our data. We could either load data by directly calling a single file, or by creating a list of file names that match some pattern.

Raster data in the 'terra' package can be held in a numberof different classes.
A SpatRaster can hold multible layers of data, but all need to be in the same CRS and have the same resolution and extent. A SpatRaster is created using the command 'rast()'
If you need to hold data of varying extents in the same object, you can use a SpatRasterCollection, which is created with the command 'sprc()'

```{r}
#Example one: Loading data by calling a single file directly
disturbanceStack <- terra::rast("data/disturbance_stack_southern_rockies.tif") #'rast' is the command to create a 'SpatRaster.'

#Example two: Loading data by creating a list of files
#Here we specify the pattern that we want to use to identify files with pattern = <>. The "*" symbol is a 'wildcard,' meaning that it stands for 'anything'
topographyFileNames <- list.files("data/data_sandbox/",
                                 pattern = "USGS*", full.names = TRUE) 
topography <- terra::rast(topographyFileNames) #'rast' can also be used to create a SpatRaster from a list of files
```
Now we can visualize some of the data

```{r}
terra::plot(topography$elevation)
```
