    "## ECOSTRESS Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[ECOSTRESS](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ecostress/overview), which stands for ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station, is a radiometer that has been attached to the International Space Station since 2018, and collects temperature data on plants. This data can be used to monitor plant life and sense how much water they are releasing to manage their temperature. From this data, we can derive evapotransporation (ET), the Evaporative Stress Index, and calculate the Water Use Efficiency (WUE) of different areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data from this sensor can be difficult to deal with. It comes in h5 format like GEDI data does, but has a very different way of extracting the relevant information. [NASA built a tool](https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/projects/LPDUR/repos/ecostress_swath2grid/browse) for users to use so that they can import any of the bands they want, alongside the geospatial band of the sensor, and create a much more familiar geotiff. The tool is in Python and can be run from a terminal. The format for changing the file format of the downloaded data is shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The list of ECOSTRESS products, their names, and the data stored in them can be found [here](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/data/science-data-products-summary-table), with additional details being shown [here](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/data/user-guide-documents-table). \n",
    "\n",
    "ECOSTRESS, like many remote sensors, has different levels of data that have been cleaned up and made ready for analysis as you get to higher levels. The level 1 data will be raw data, or close to raw data, collected by the satellite that hasn't had many corrections or quality checks ran on it, if any at all. For ECOSTRESS, they provide raw radiance data, geolocation data, and other metadata such as the attitude the images were taken at. Thankfully, while these can be useful, NASA also provides products that combine this data with other data sources to run quality checks and corrections, and then use that to calculate different types of scientific data. Since the ECOSTRESS really is about detecting temperatures, it can be used in awesome ways to monitor active fires when it passes over them. It gets surface temperature information, which is a unique lens to view events like forest fires, as seen here from NASA's website viewing the 2022 Oak fire in California:\n",

A document explaining the work flow of how this product is created can be found [on NASA's website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/downloads/userguides/4b_ECOSTRESS_UserGuide_L4_WUE_20190618.pdf). Reading the documentation, we can see that the units are gross primary production over evapotranspiration (GPP/ET)\n",

    "## Using `rioxarray` to open raster data\n",
    "\n",
    "`rioxarray` is a package built on top of `xarray`, a powerful tool that can be used to handle raster data in many formats in Python. While there are many packages that can be used to do similar things, such as `rasterio` or `h5py`, one of the advantages of `rioxarray` is it's ability to open up many types of files easily, such as `.tif`, `.h5`, and `.netcdf` file, all of which are common file types in geospatial analysis. Here we use it to open up the `.tif` file, which we can then clip, access the data from, and plot. For more information on using `rioxarray` in Python, see our lesson [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/fundamentals-raster-data/open-lidar-raster-python-xarray/)."

We'll use the `plot_bands` function found in `earthpy.plot` to easily plot our raster data. The function takes in rasters and will plot either a single band or multiple bands next to each other depending on how many bands are in your data. It is a good quick way to visualize raster data. \n",

We do this instead of interpolating data to avoid using data that was never actually collected. "
